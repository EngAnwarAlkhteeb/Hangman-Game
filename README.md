# Hangman Game

Hangman is a timeless classic, bringing the excitement of word-guessing to your fingertips. The objective is straightforward: uncover the mystery word or phrase by guessing the correct letters.

Upon starting, you'll be faced with a series of blank spaces, each representing a hidden letter. Utilize your keyboard to guess letters, starting with the commonly used vowels. A correct guess reveals all instances of that letter in the word.

As you progressively unveil more letters, the challenge intensifies, allowing you to piece together the answer. However, be cautious-every incorrect guess results in the appearance of the hangman, gradually inching towards a complete depiction.

Keep a keen eye on your lives; each incorrect guess costs you one, and the hangman emerges piece by piece. The objective is to solve the puzzle before the hangman meets his fate.
